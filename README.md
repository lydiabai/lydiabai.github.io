## My personal page

## Overview

#### Motivation

- I really liked this guy's website: http://onepagelove.com/zack-batsaikhan
- My target audience is Friends/Family/Fans
-This is a fun portfolio with a collection of photos that can be categorized by: Fun, Family, Facts

#### Content
- I want to post a series of pictures
- I want three categories: Fun, Family, Facts
- 
- A self intro and links on how to contact me. 

#### Design
- it is very minimalist and I almost want all the pictures to be greyscale and take up the whole website
- i want to website to seem like its all in one page and you just scroll down/ when you click a link it takes you down the page or you can scroll down the page
